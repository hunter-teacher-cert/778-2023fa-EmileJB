    <center><h1>With the previous encounter with that golem and overall atmosphere of this dungeon, you couldn't risk those statues being golems. Afterall, there appeared to be three of them and it appeared they might have weapons. They needed to be taken care of as soon as possible. You take out your crossbow and load it with a unique explosive bolt and fire. However when you go to examine the rubble, it appears to be the now shattered, petrified remains of the lost party! While you technically did solve the case, you probably weren't going to get paid for it... and there's the problem of accidental murder.</h1></center>

      <p>You decide to examine the feminine statue for clues, but as soon as you get close the statue decides to move! Luckily, you were already on guard so you were quick enough to roll away from what you determine to be a golem and keep your distance. The golem was quicker than it looked, but not as quick as you were. You kited the monster while wearing it down with volleys of crossbow bolts until eventually, the golem just crumbles. Having dealt with that monster, you proceed to the next room where you spot what you think are three statues in the distance...</p>
