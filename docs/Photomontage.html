<center><h3><b>Nature Goat</b></h3></center>
<center><br><img src="images/NatureGoat.jpg" alt="Gogoat Fake"></center>
<br><br><p>I had no idea what I wanted to make for these two pictures so I clicked random file on wikimedia for a while until some things came to me. The first image I got was the goat, and having recently finished the latest Pokemon game, I wanted to add some elements to the goat to give it a somewhat similar feel. I decided to replace the goat's white fur with lush greens, so I masked out the white fur and put the green under the goat. I then decided to make the horns more rock like, so I selected the goat's horns, but this time I used that selection on the canyon layer to mask out everything but that area and put that layer on top of the goat. I then played around with blending options on the canyon layer until I got to vivid light, and reduced the opacity. Finally, I also ended up reducing the opacity and increasing the feathering of the layer mask on the goat so the grass would fit a bit more with the goat.</p><br>

<center><h3><b>Underwater City</b></h3></center>
<center><br><img src="images/UnderwaterCity.jpg" alt="Not Atlantis"></center>
<br><br><p>This second picture required a lot more clicking on random file than the first one. I ended up finding landscape scenery through some building, and thought that would be the perfect viewport to whatever I made, so I masked out everything that wasn't a part of the actual building. I wanted this picture to also have a sense of wonder to it, but having gone with a nature concept in the first picture I decided to go in the opposite direction and look for cities. Finding a city near the water, I decided to be a bit weird and but the city's reflection in the water in the viewport instead of the actual city. Since this scene was not underwater, I'd need some more details to sell it, so I decided to use a picture of a school of fish underwater. I then again played with blending options, but this time to with a goal to create a more fantastic look, which I achieved using Luminosity. My final touches on this were to create a masking layer for the fish layer and make the buildings a bit more visible.</p>
