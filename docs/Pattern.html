<p>For this first pattern I got the colors using Adobe Color. I decided to use an analogous color scheme and played around with the wheel. I ended up using the colors that seemed the most visually distinct from each other. I then built the pattern using shapes geometric shapes, square background, two four point stars, an octagon, and a circle. The more blue colors were used for shapes deeper into the background while the redder colors were used for the shapes more in the foreground. I arranged the shapes with particular interest to vertices and midpoints. The tile was then arranged in a grid and I found the results interesting. Although I didn’t have them in mind, by turning this tile into a pattern it created a variety of shapes of different colors depending on where and how you look. While I do like the pattern, I admit that the patterns are somewhat bright and obnoxious, so it may be better on a printed surface than on screen. I could imagine it as gift wrap or the wallpaper for a young girl’s bedroom.</p>

<center><br><img src="images/CosmicSpiral.png" alt="Spacey"></center>
<br><br>
<p>This pattern I got from using the color mood feature on Adobe Color. I used a picture of the cosmos then used the deep setting to pick the color. I customized it a little bit by changing one of the colors to a “color” I’ve loved since high school, which I’ve called “space purple”. With my colors selected, I then worked on arranging the pattern. Since I was using colors from space I wanted to make a space like design. I used a “black” background (maybe midnight blue?). I decided to make a spiral as it could represent a galaxy or a black hole. I made another smaller spiral inside that spiral so that the spiral was purple with a bright blue outline. I adjusted the stroke size of each and made the stroke “charcoal” instead of solid. I’m not entirely sure why, but I liked the look of it. At this point the spiral was complete but the tile seemed empty on the top right. This is when I created several “comets” on the outside of the spiral by making circles of different sizes with “charcoal” outlines of different stroke sizes. I then made the pattern but realized that the background color was interfering and blocking part of the spirals, so I decided to give the tile a transparent background. I then went back to make the pattern and arranged it in a hex by column, and used the pattern edit tool to adjust the tile so that the spirals would just touch each other without overlapping. My friend said that she would use the design as a carpet. I think the pattern could also work as a wallpaper of some sorts as well as a background if one wanted to make it fancy.</p>
