<center><h1>About Emile</h1>
<img src="images/MediaSelfie.jpg" alt="Selfie" width="400"></center>
<p> I use media as one of my primary methods of achieving my goal to entertain those around me. I am a strong believer in the in the idea behind the phrase “laughter is the best medicine”; There must be something people do when they are not doing their job, having a bad day, or feeling down from the state of the world, and I know from my own experiences that media such as television, movies, websites, and video games have always helped me have fun and get through these situations. As of right now my media productions are mostly limited to memes and funny photoshops. While some of this is for the public, most of the works I make are geared more towards people close to me, because I know and understand them. I hope to be able to expand the range of people that my media effects and become more proficient in different types, particularly web design and video games.</p>
