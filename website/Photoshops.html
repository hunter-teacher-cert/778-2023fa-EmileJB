<p>I titled this image Red Recycle, for obvious reasons. My idea when making this picture was to add a sense of "doom and gloom" to an otherwise helpful object. The redness of the picture was created by turning the temperature and the tint to the max. However, at this point the image only looked like itself with a red tint, so I adjusted the exposure to -3.00 to make the image darker. I also played with other settings such as contrast, highlight, shadows, and blacks to get the image to the particular darkness aesthetic I wanted, but still bright enough to differentiate between objects.</p>

<p>This image is also uncreatively called Blue Fountain, because water is often depicted as blue. The blueness was created by lowering the temperature and slightly raising the tint and messing with the vibrance. The original photo was a bit dark so I brightened it up by increasing the exposure. Furthermore, I wanted the image to be as crisp as possible so I turned the clarity all the way up and adjusted the contrast for that goal as well.</p>
<br>
<center><img src="images/ControlPanel.png" alt="Control Panel"></center>
<p>In terms of editing the aesthetic, I did the least amount of changes to the control panel. The original picture did not look as good as I had wanted, so my goal with photoshop was just to enhance it. Increasing the exposure was fixed the problem I had the most with the photo, which was the lighting. Adjusting the clarity, shadow, and vibrance also helped bring more brightness to the photo and make the buttons pop more. However, I had to find the right balance of adjustments to make, because at too high an intensity it looked to much and cheesy.</p>
