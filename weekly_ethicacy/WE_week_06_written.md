For this Weekly Ethicacy I took the stance that developers do not have an ethical obligation to limit usage based on screen-time or late night use. One reason that I believe this is that while I do acknowledge that there are physical and mental health risks associated with excessive screen time, I worry about the effects of giving tech companies more justification to control how users use their app, which is already an inherent problem in tech. Plus, with how our knowledge of medical information can change as time goes on or how easily medical myths may spread, developers may make decisions seemingly guided by screen-time related effects on health that have no actual justification. The other reason that I believe that it is not up to the developers to account for users screen time or late night usage is that there are already a number of tools and techniques that people can use to mitigate the effects of late night or excessive screen time. Some examples include adjusting display settings or buying blue light blocking glasses, buying ergonomic equipment such as ergonomic mouses or ergonomic chairs, or employing the 20-20-20 rule which is to look at something 20 meters away for 20 seconds after 20 minutes of screen time, although these are not the only tools. Furthermore, there may be some cases where limiting screen time access may end up being more detrimental to a person than if it were not limited, such as if someone needs to pull an all-nighter to keep their job (although this shouldn't be a regular occurance.)
